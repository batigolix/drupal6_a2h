msgid "\r\n      <h3>Introduction</h3>\r\n      <p>The taxonomy_image module allows site administrators to associate images with category terms.  Once defined, this association allows Drupal themes to display images with site content.  For example, the taxonomy_image module might be used to display a penguin with content about Linux, and a cheeseburger with content about junk food.</p>\r\n      <p>The module allows both a one-to-one term-to-image relationship, and a many-to-one terms-to-image relationship.</p>\r\n      <p>The taxonomy_image module requires that the taxonomy module also be enabled.</p>\r\n      <h3>Configuration</h3>\r\n      <h4>Uploading images</h4>\r\n      <p>With the taxonomy_image module enabled, images can be uploaded and associated with category terms at \"administer >> categories\".  On that page you will find tables containing all your vocabularies and terms.  Next to each term is a link titled \"upload image\" which you can click to upload an image for that term.  After clicking that link, you will be brought to another page with a small \"Add images\" form.  Using the \"browse\" button you can select your image then click \"Save\".\r\n      <p>Continue this process to upload appropriate images for your category terms.  Note that by default images will be displayed at the size they were uploaded.  Alternatively, you can go to \"administer >> settings >> taxonomy_image\" to force the display height and/or width of all taxonomy images.</p>\r\n      <h4>Permissions</h4>\r\n      <p>For your users to be able to view the images you have uploaded, you will need to give them the necessary permissions.  Only users with the \"access taxonomy images\" permission will see images.  If you wish to give your users the ability to disable the images, also give them the \"can disable taxonomy images\" permission.</p>\r\n      <p>A third permission, \"administer taxonomy images\", controls which users are allowed to configure taxonomy images.</p>\r\n      <h4>Recursive image display</h4>\r\n      <p>Taxonomy is a very powerful tool.  One of its features is providing the ability to create hierarchical vocabularies, with which you can build a tree of terms.  It is possible that an entire tree of terms, or even just a branch of terms, are all about a similar subject and should all be associated with the same image.  By going to \"administer >> settings >> taxonomy_image\", you can enable \"Recursive image disaply\".  With this option enabled, you only need to configure an image for the parent term, and all children will automatically inheret the same image (unless they are manually configured to display an alternative image).</p>\r\n      <h3>Displaying images</h3>\r\n      <p>To actually display images from your theme, you will have to modify the theme to make a call to taxonomy_image_display().  When calling this function, you will need to pass in the taxonomy term for which an image should be displayed.  For example, from your theme's \"_node\" function you might do the following:\r\n<pre>\r\n  foreach (taxonomy_node_get_terms($node->nid) as $term) {\r\n    if ($image = taxonomy_image_display($term->tid)) {\r\n      $output .= \\\"$image\\\";\r\n    }\r\n</pre>\r\n    <p>Taxonomy_image_display uses \"theme('image',...\" so you may override the display in your theme layer.</p>\r\n    "
